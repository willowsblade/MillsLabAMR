# MillsLabAMR
Mills Lab pipeline to analyze metagenomic sequencing data for AMR genes.  This pipeline uses tools developed by others, list of citations to be added to this page ASAP (hopefully complete by end of July 2017, if nothing more urgent takes over my life)

First part involves analysis for transferable antimicrobial resistance genes using ResFinder

Second part involves analysis for all antimicrobial resistance genes using AMR++
